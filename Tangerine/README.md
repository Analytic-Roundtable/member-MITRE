title: Tangerine -- Analysis Exchange Prototype
---

Tangerine
=========

Tangerine is MITRE's prototype that demonstrates the ideas in the
Analysis Exchange \[MITRE 1\]. The scope of this prototype is
three-fold:

-   Demonstrate the [Transfer Services](transfer-services.htm) for
    exchanging raw inputs and analytic results on them
-   Provide a [test client](test-client.htm) to exercise the services
-   Illustrate the process of creating analytic adapters and devising
    custom ontologies for specific use cases.
